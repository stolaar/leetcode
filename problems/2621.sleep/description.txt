Given&nbsp;a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis&nbsp;milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: millis = 100
Output: 100
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.
let t = Date.now();
sleep(100).then(() =&gt; {
  console.log(Date.now() - t); // 100
});


Example 2:


Input: millis = 200
Output: 200
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 200ms.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= millis &lt;= 1000
