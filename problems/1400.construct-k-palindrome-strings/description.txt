Given a string s and an integer k, return true if you can use all the characters in s to construct k palindrome strings or false otherwise.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;annabelle&quot;, k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: You can construct two palindromes using all characters in s.
Some possible constructions &quot;anna&quot; + &quot;elble&quot;, &quot;anbna&quot; + &quot;elle&quot;, &quot;anellena&quot; + &quot;b&quot;


Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;leetcode&quot;, k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to construct 3 palindromes using all the characters of s.


Example 3:


Input: s = &quot;true&quot;, k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: The only possible solution is to put each character in a separate string.

Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105
	s consists of lowercase English letters.
	1 &lt;= k &lt;= 105
