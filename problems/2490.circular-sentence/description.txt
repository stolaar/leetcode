A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.


	For example, &quot;Hello World&quot;, &quot;HELLO&quot;, &quot;hello world hello world&quot; are all sentences.


Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is circular if:


	The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
	The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.


For example, &quot;leetcode exercises sound delightful&quot;, &quot;eetcode&quot;, &quot;leetcode eats soul&quot; are all circular sentences. However, &quot;Leetcode is cool&quot;, &quot;happy Leetcode&quot;, &quot;Leetcode&quot; and &quot;I like Leetcode&quot; are not circular sentences.

Given a string sentence, return true if it is circular. Otherwise, return false.
