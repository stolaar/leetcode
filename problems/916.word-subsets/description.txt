You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.


	For example, &quot;wrr&quot; is a subset of &quot;warrior&quot; but is not a subset of &quot;world&quot;.


A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:


Input: words1 = [&quot;amazon&quot;,&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;leetcode&quot;], words2 = [&quot;e&quot;,&quot;o&quot;]
Output: [&quot;facebook&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;leetcode&quot;]


Example 2:


Input: words1 = [&quot;amazon&quot;,&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;leetcode&quot;], words2 = [&quot;l&quot;,&quot;e&quot;]
Output: [&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;leetcode&quot;]


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= words1.length, words2.length &lt;= 104
	1 &lt;= words1[i].length, words2[i].length &lt;= 10
	words1[i] and words2[i] consist only of lowercase English letters.
	All the strings of words1 are unique.
