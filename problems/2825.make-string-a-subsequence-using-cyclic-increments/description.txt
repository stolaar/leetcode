You are given two 0-indexed strings str1 and str2.

In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically. That is &#39;a&#39; becomes &#39;b&#39;, &#39;b&#39; becomes &#39;c&#39;, and so on, and &#39;z&#39; becomes &#39;a&#39;.

Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.

Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

Example 1:


Input: str1 = &quot;abc&quot;, str2 = &quot;ad&quot;
Output: true
Explanation: Select index 2 in str1.
Increment str1[2] to become &#39;d&#39;. 
Hence, str1 becomes &quot;abd&quot; and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned.

Example 2:


Input: str1 = &quot;zc&quot;, str2 = &quot;ad&quot;
Output: true
Explanation: Select indices 0 and 1 in str1. 
Increment str1[0] to become &#39;a&#39;. 
Increment str1[1] to become &#39;d&#39;. 
Hence, str1 becomes &quot;ad&quot; and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned.

Example 3:


Input: str1 = &quot;ab&quot;, str2 = &quot;d&quot;
Output: false
Explanation: In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 using the operation at most once. 
Therefore, false is returned.

Constraints:


	1 &lt;= str1.length &lt;= 105
	1 &lt;= str2.length &lt;= 105
	str1 and str2 consist of only lowercase English letters.
