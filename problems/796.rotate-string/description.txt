Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.


	For example, if s = &quot;abcde&quot;, then it will be &quot;bcdea&quot; after one shift.


&nbsp;
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length, goal.length &lt;= 100
	s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.
