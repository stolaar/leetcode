Write a function that checks if a given value&nbsp;is an instance of a given class or superclass. For this problem, an object is considered an instance of a given class if that object has access to that class&#39;s methods.

There are&nbsp;no constraints on the data types that can be passed to the function. For example, the value or the class could be&nbsp;undefined.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: func = () =&gt; checkIfInstanceOf(new Date(), Date)
Output: true
Explanation: The object returned by the Date constructor is, by definition, an instance of Date.


Example 2:


Input: func = () =&gt; { class Animal {}; class Dog extends Animal {}; return checkIfInstanceOf(new Dog(), Animal); }
Output: true
Explanation:
class Animal {};
class Dog extends Animal {};
checkIfInstanceOf(new Dog(), Animal); // true

Dog is a subclass of Animal. Therefore, a Dog object is an instance of both Dog and Animal.

Example 3:


Input: func = () =&gt; checkIfInstanceOf(Date, Date)
Output: false
Explanation: A date constructor cannot logically be an instance of itself.


Example 4:


Input: func = () =&gt; checkIfInstanceOf(5, Number)
Output: true
Explanation: 5 is a Number. Note that the &quot;instanceof&quot; keyword would return false. However, it is still considered an instance of Number because it accesses the Number methods. For example &quot;toFixed()&quot;.
