Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.


Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --&gt; 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --&gt; 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.


Example 3:


Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
	-1000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000
	-1000 &lt;= targetSum &lt;= 1000
