You are given an array of integers nums and the head of a linked list. Return the head of the modified linked list after removing all nodes from the linked list that have a value that exists in nums.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3], head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [4,5]

Explanation:



Remove the nodes with values 1, 2, and 3.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1], head = [1,2,1,2,1,2]

Output: [2,2,2]

Explanation:



Remove the nodes with value 1.


Example 3:


Input: nums = [5], head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [1,2,3,4]

Explanation:



No node has value 5.

Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 105
	1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 105
	All elements in nums are unique.
	The number of nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 105].
	1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 105
	The input is generated such that there is at least one node in the linked list that has a value not present in nums.
