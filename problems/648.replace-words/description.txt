In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let&#39;s call this word derivative. For example, when the root &quot;help&quot; is followed by the word &quot;ful&quot;, we can form a derivative &quot;helpful&quot;.

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:


Input: dictionary = [&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;bat&quot;,&quot;rat&quot;], sentence = &quot;the cattle was rattled by the battery&quot;
Output: &quot;the cat was rat by the bat&quot;


Example 2:


Input: dictionary = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;], sentence = &quot;aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs&quot;
Output: &quot;a a b c&quot;
