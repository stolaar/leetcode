You are given an array words of size n consisting of non-empty strings.

We define the score of a string word as the number of strings words[i] such that word is a prefix of words[i].


	For example, if words = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;cab&quot;], then the score of &quot;ab&quot; is 2, since &quot;ab&quot; is a prefix of both &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;abc&quot;.


Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the sum of scores of every non-empty prefix of words[i].

Note that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.

Example 1:


Input: words = [&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;bc&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]
Output: [5,4,3,2]
Explanation: The answer for each string is the following:
- &quot;abc&quot; has 3 prefixes: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, and &quot;abc&quot;.
- There are 2 strings with the prefix &quot;a&quot;, 2 strings with the prefix &quot;ab&quot;, and 1 string with the prefix &quot;abc&quot;.
The total is answer[0] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
- &quot;ab&quot; has 2 prefixes: &quot;a&quot; and &quot;ab&quot;.
- There are 2 strings with the prefix &quot;a&quot;, and 2 strings with the prefix &quot;ab&quot;.
The total is answer[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
- &quot;bc&quot; has 2 prefixes: &quot;b&quot; and &quot;bc&quot;.
- There are 2 strings with the prefix &quot;b&quot;, and 1 string with the prefix &quot;bc&quot;.
The total is answer[2] = 2 + 1 = 3.
- &quot;b&quot; has 1 prefix: &quot;b&quot;.
- There are 2 strings with the prefix &quot;b&quot;.
The total is answer[3] = 2.


Example 2:


Input: words = [&quot;abcd&quot;]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
&quot;abcd&quot; has 4 prefixes: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, and &quot;abcd&quot;.
Each prefix has a score of one, so the total is answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Constraints:
