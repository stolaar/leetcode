Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library&#39;s sort function.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]


Example 2:


Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	n == nums.length
	1 &lt;= n &lt;= 300
	nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
