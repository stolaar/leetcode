Given the root of a&nbsp;binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes&#39; values.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]


Example 2:


Input: root = []
Output: []


Example 3:


Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
	-100 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 100
