Given a binary tree root and a&nbsp;linked list with&nbsp;head&nbsp;as the first node.&nbsp;

Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the head correspond to some downward path connected in the binary tree&nbsp;otherwise return False.

In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes downwards.

&nbsp;
Example 1:




Input: head = [4,2,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: Nodes in blue form a subpath in the binary Tree.  


Example 2:




Input: head = [1,4,2,6], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
Output: true


Example 3:


Input: head = [1,4,2,6,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no path in the binary tree that contains all the elements of the linked list from head.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 2500].
	The number of nodes in the list will be in the range [1, 100].
	1 &lt;= Node.val&nbsp;&lt;= 100&nbsp;for each node in the linked list and binary tree.
