# LeetCode Solutions in Go

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository, where I tackle problems using Go. This repository is organized to help you navigate through the solutions efficiently.

## Repository Structure

### `cli` Directory

The `cli` directory contains a module for creating starter code for daily problems and for solving a specific problem by its title slug.

### `problems` Directory

The `problems` directory stores the problems being solved. Each problem is stored in its own directory with the following convention:

```
ID.title-slug/
â””â”€â”€ title-slug.go
```

Where:
- `ID`: The LeetCode problem ID.
- `title-slug`: The URL-friendly title of the problem.

### Getting Started

To use the CLI module for creating starter code:
1. Build the CLI
```bash
go build -o leetcode cli/*.go
```
2. Add the executable in your path and run the following command to see the usage
```bash
leetcode
```

### Contributing
